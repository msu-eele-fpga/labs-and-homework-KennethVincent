# homework 10: Device tree intro
## By: Kenneth Vincent

## Overveiw
In this lab we will learn to setup and modify the hardware on the 
arm chip on the FPGA with the use of device trees.

## Question
The device tree is used with embedded Linux as a standard way to describe the properties of the 
hardware in a way that It could be dynamically configured with new properties. The device tree
writes these properties into the kernel of the linux distro.
