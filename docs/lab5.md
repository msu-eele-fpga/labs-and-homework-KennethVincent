# Lab 5 - symbol tab analysis intro
### By: Kenneth Vincent


## Overveiw
The purpose of this lab is to learn of Signal Tap, which is an embedded logic 
analyzer tool in Quartus that can be used to debug FPGA designs.

## Deliverables
Here is the screenshot of the state transitioning from s0 to s4 which is my custom pattern on a custom clock rate.

## Questons
1) on the FPGA chip about 12544 bits was used to monitor my signals.
