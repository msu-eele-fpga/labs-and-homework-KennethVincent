# lab 7: Verifying your Custom Component using System Console and /dev/mem
### by: Kenneth Vincent

## Overveiw
In the last lab, we created custom components using the Platform Designer by developing a Avalon 
bus wrapper for the LED patterns component. For this lab we will be verifying that this hardware is
working before devling deeper into the software development side of FPGAs. This will be done in both
the system console and through putty and micro sd cards in the FPGA.

## Questions
1) What hex value did you write to base_period to have a 0.125 second base period?
                 the hex value used is 0x09

2) What hex value did you write to base_period to have a 0.5625 second base period?
                 the hex value used is 0x02
